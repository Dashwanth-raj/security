## Core Features:

- License Plate Capture: Vehicle Number Input: Manual and automatic number entry using device camera, which requires temporary access permission on install. Camera view is only active while explicitly in use for license plate recognition.
- Purpose Description: Entry Purpose Input: A clear form to document the reason for vehicle entry.
- AI-Assisted Input: AI powered suggested tool that uses collected and ingested user inputs about "Purpose Description" in the past to auto complete the purpose. LLM provides high confidence options only and prompts for clarification for novel descriptions.
- Authority Directory: Authority Contact: A list of authority figures to contact to grant permission for vehicle entry.
- Simplified Approval: After authority is contacted through device and communicates their approval, use a simple button tap for logging approval of vehicle entry and time of entry.
- Streamlined Exit: Simplified "one tap" time-stamping when the vehicles leave the premises, linking the action with the vehicle number and previously provided entry details. Capture # of occupants on exit.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for trust and security.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to draw attention to primary actions.
- Clear, standard typography to ensure clarity and ease of reading, with distinct headings and form labels.
- Use universally-recognized icons to aid navigation, with unique identifiers to confirm when authority approval is in process versus already complete.
- Consistent layout with a top navigation bar for settings and an easily navigable main form.
- Use simple transitions, like fades for confirmations or slide-ins to display contextual information to avoid overwhelming the user with superfluous animations.
